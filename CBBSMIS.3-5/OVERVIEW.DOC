     Here's a quick overview of CBBS.  It's just the thoughts 
off the top of my head.

					Ward.


CBBS is designed to work with S-100 modems, but there should be
no troubles using it with outboard modems.

Steve Vinokuroff of Vancouver B.C. Canada has been the first to
try it, as well as double density. I have put together another
module, CBBSMODM.ASM which is a skeleton for using CBBS with an
outboard modem.  I plan to test it locally using my serial
port, and my sense switch to simulate two bits in: carrier
detect, and ring detect.

CBBS will work with 1 disk, 2 is better.  The bigger the
better, up to a point, where you might have so many messages on
the disks that it takes a new user too long to go thru the
summaries.  Randy and I keep about 300 messages active on
CBBS/Chicago, and that seem OK.  200 would probably also be OK. 
We find 300 is the number that "happens" due to a 2-month-old
message delete policy.

CBBS currently has no auto-delete.  With clocks becoming more
prevalent, perhaps that's not so hard to do, some time in the
future.

Our CBBS works as follows thanks to a "kludge" board Randy put
together.  He also put a solid state relay on the diskette
drive spin motors.  We hear the main bearing is the first thing
to go out on a diskette drive.

When the phone rings, this resets the system, and starts a 30
second one shot.  The 30 second one-shot disables ringing from
resetting the system again, and starts the diskette drive spin
motors.  We are using a Tarbell single density controller, and
the reset causes it to boot.  We just converted to CP/M 1.4.
The BIOS would require major mods if you have 2.0.  We have
modified the CP/M BIOS so that, on cold boot, rather than just
JMPing to CCP, if sense switch 80H is up (we put a SSW on a
parallel port, using a dip-switch 'cause we had no front
panel), then CBBS.COM is loaded and branched to.  (CBBS was
originally called "CE" or "CE.C" so that's where some such
names come from, such as "CEBIOS.ASM").

That technique was required with 1.3, but now with 1.4, you can
autoboot into CBBS by patching CBBS into the command buffer at
CCP+8, and a hex 04 (the length of the word "CBBS") into CCP+7.

Booting in CBBS takes less than 30 seconds (but long enough
that a few users have had to modify their terminal programs,
which time out due to the number of rings before CBBS answers).

When CBBS gets control, it outputs to a control port, which the
kludge board decodes, and thus leaves the spin motors on.  Thus
the 30 second one shot is or-ed with this output port, to
determine if the motors are to spin or not.

CBBS then issues the output commands to take the modem off­
hook, and put out carrier.

We then wait 15 seconds for the incoming carrier. If you have a
baud-rate-settable modem, we then set to 110, and go read a
character.  If it's a carriage return (C/R) then we continue at
110 baud.  We use 2 stop bits at 110, and 1 at all higher
rates.  We don't bother with parity, and send 8 full data bits,
to allow future expansion to where you might want to transfer
fully transparent binary data via CBBS (such as when we use a
modem transfer program).

The baud rate is switched to 300, 450, then 600, to 110 (at the
"end" of 600), then back to the beginning, 110, each time
reading a character to see if it is a C/R.  15 loops are made
(75 characters read in all) before giving up.  When we give up,
we output to the control port again to turn off the spin
motors, output to the modem to hang up the phone, and then JMP
up to a PROM monitor, which does nothing.  We could just as
well have gone into a loop in CBBS, because the next phone ring
would reset the system, and start things all over again.

We also do a double read of the C/R to make sure a glitched
character isn't interpreted as a C/R at the wrong speed.

		----------------

Not all users will elect to put together such functions as
Randy did, and wild instead choose to run CBBS memory resident. 
An equate, REINIT, allows this, if set true. All the flags
(upper case mode, operator mode, etc) are reset, and CBBS loops
looking at ring detect.

		----------------

If you do not choose to use our BIOS, then you will have to
make your own, which need follow only these guidelines:


The console I/O functions (sÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿlows the CBBS operators to
converse with callers if they find them in trouble, or find a
friend on the system, etc.  This is all pretty standard coding. 
Examples may be found in CEBIOS.ASM on the diskette.

The only non-standard thing in the BIOS is the carrier detect.  
To prevent CBBS being hung up at console in with a loss of
carrier, return TRUE (0FFH) froÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿarrier is lost,
and also return 0FFH from console in, if carrier is lost.  
Do not do a WAIT to see if it's a temporary glitch, CBBS will
wait 1 second before looking again.  Don't just take control
away from CBBS, as it might be in the middle of a disk write,
such as if someone hangs up while leaving comments.  We set
flags saying carrier is lost, and test a flag saying we can't
go away just now, until the disk is properly closed.  (Comments
elsewhere explain how "BYE" thus could present problems)

Conceivably, someone could hang up, such as during writing
comments, and another person call up and reset the system too
soon, but we have not had that happen, to the best of our
knowledge, in over 50,000 calls.

		  ----------------

What's next?  Get a listing of all the CBBS .ASM files, as well
as all the .DOC files, and go thru COOKBOOK.DOC.  You will be
expected to make some changes to the .ASM files, to tailor them
to your environment, or just to change references to "Ward and
Randy", and to "CBBS/Chicago.

It is my intent to ship a working CBBS.COM for just "dinking
around" with CBBS, i.e. entering messages, trying the operator
functions, etc.  We will include some messages which you might
like to pattern your own after, such as the one on expert user
mode, etc.  We recommend setting the starting message number
perhaps at 20, or perhaps 100, as this leaves some "permanent
system message" area open from 1-19.

This test CBBS is a 1 disk version, which you may use to 
familiarize yourself with CBBS operation.  

The test version of CBBS is supplied with the operator-mode
flag already set.

The operatgÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿASS.  If it didn't work, it will log a "security
failure" to the log, and tell you it didn't know what you mean
by "PASS".


		  ----------------

		What to watch for:

As you will learn from reading the CBBS .ASM files, CBBS is not
some elegant, efficient, well written piece of programming
artistry.  It's more like a software patchwork quilt, with
things tacked on here and there.  No attempt at structured
programming was done.  I did pull out some obvious duplication
of code in some places.  It is moderately commented, enough
that anyone familiar with CP/M and 8080 assembler, who wants to
get CBBS up, can and did. 

CBBS had one goal in mind - that it be relatively simple.  The
main .ASM files are not over 8000 lines, but I still feel that
is true:  there are no fancy data structures on the disk.  All
files are editable with any standard CP/M editor (ED,
Wordmaster).  The only minor thing is the use of a bell (07H)
delimiter for messages ioÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿand "]" have certain meanings in other files.

The ORIGINAL CBBS organized it's message and summary files as
follows:  10 messages were written to each message file.  The
name of the file was MESSAGE.nnX, i.e. message 133 was in file
MESSAGE.13X.  Similarly, the summary file wÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿhat made things quite easy.  Want to
summarize starting at message 123? Just open file SUMMARY.1XX,
scan for "(bell)123" and start typing.  Waoÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿûÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ bell header, erase the summary, make
it, and write it back from memory.  This was quite fast.  Same
lgÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿage file, except that instead of just
compressing it out of memory, it was written to the tail-end of
"KILLED" file, so operators could see short-lived messages, or
messages which were mischievously killed. 

Ok, what's the problem?  Well, when we got up around 550
(numbers, not active), then there weren't enough directory
entries available.  Each file, whether it contains only 1
message, or all 10 were still present, took a directory entry.

Messages had to be packed every now and then (as often as
weekly, on a busy system).  This was an inconvenience to users,
as message 524 would become 219 or some such, and they couldn't
tell where to pick up from the last time they called in.  Also,
someone would leave a message which says "in regard to your
message 524" which would not be 524 after the pack.

So, in July 1979, portions of CBBS were rewritten, and the
package given the name "version 3".  Message numbers went to 5
digits, and would never be reused or packed. Later, keeping
track of the number of active messages was also added.  If you
ever think this number got out of sync, use the program T.COM
supplied on the disk, to count the lines in the summary file. 
(T SUMMARY #)  This, divided by 2, should be the number of
active messages stored at the third parameter in the file
"NEXT".  Alternatively, BUILDSUM will TELL you the number.

The simplicity of the file name selection which was used for
the previous version, was similar in version 3 for message
files, except that the low order digits of the message number
was used.

For example, message 1234 would be written to file MESSAGE.X34. 
Message 1235 was also written to this file, because CBBS did an
integer divide of 35 by 2, getting 17, then multiplied by 2,
getting 34.  This is done in routine "SETMSGN".  We tried a
"ANI" technique with a mask over the low ASCII digit of the
file number, but that didn't work too well, so we went to the
divide-and-multiply technique.  On a double density system with
128 entries in the directory, you might want to go to having
100 message files, by settingÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿeve, and kill.

This technique spread the messages around nicely. No message
file got out of hand size-wise.

Unfortunately, I was unable to come up with a similarly simple
approach for the summary file.  I admit fancy techniques could
be used, such as an "indexed" random-access approach, but
remember the "S" and "Q" command search the summary
sequentially, and you don't want perfoÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿûF…)ª¦¦ ©,—7ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿk, as summary numbers can take any value
from 00001 to, well, however many messages a given CBBS will
ever get!  CBBS/Chicago is currently at message 10200.  Thus,
to make "S" and "Q" work quickly, I went to a single summary
file.  This caused a problem, since it might be too big to fit
into memory, during the kill.  Other than this, there would be
no need to have more than 24K in a CBBS system.  So, Kill now
works as follows, (instead of the read in, erase, write back
like before):  The summary is flagged, and the operators, under
operator mode, use a new PURGE command to pass the summary thru
memory once to delete ALL flagged summaries.

		  ----------------

I have written a BUILDSUM program to reconstruct the summary
file.  Also supplied is a crude CONVERT.ASC program to convert
previous CBBS files to the oÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ50 message files. I'll try to come up
with a new more generalized one, if you old-CBBS operators ask
hard enough for it. (No one has - so I won't)

		  ----------------

The future of CBBS:  Lots of people are interested in CBBS type
systems sharing messages.  That is of course quite hard to
manage, due to the cost of long distance phone calling.  Also
it's difficult to determine which messages are eligible for
forwarding.  Do you just take all that ask to be forwarded, or
have a file of people who are allowed to forward?  ..or build a
file of message numbers which have been asked to be forwarded,
then as operators, validate the list?  Wow, many more questions
than answers.

Some CBBS systems might like to go to a mailbox system for
certain users;  Others might like to add a feature which keeps
track of a caller's last time called, i.e. high message number,
date called, etc.  There is certainly no limit to the ideas
which can be thought up, just a limit to who has the time and
energy to implement them.

A totally new generation of CBBS software, I feel, would have
to be based around more of a "transaction monitor" like the big
computer systems have, i.e. rather than CBBS having to be a
gigantic program, there could be a monitor which brings in the
needed pieces as overlays.  Conceptually this is not difficult. 
It could be done by re-writing CCP to be the monitor, and have
it call in .COM files on request.  The problem would be sharing
common subroutines, such as those file-related ones in CBBS
like EXTEND, SETRD, RDBYTE, etc.  

This would probably be most easily done by making a ROOT CBBS
with all the necessary subroutines, and have overlays for
entry, kill, summary, etc.  Then CBBS could easily be extended. 
I still have this idea in the back of my mind, but it will take
quite a bit of time to convert it.  Another problem is that
each overlay will take another directory entry, and with 50
message files already (could go to less?) the directory of a
single density disk would not be enough.

It does sound intriguing, maybe someday it will happen.  I 
particularly like the idea since, for example, private
mailboxes, or program download could be implemented more
easily.

	  --------------------------------

Thanks for buying CBBS.  The $50 goes to keeping CBBS/Chicago
alive and well, (just bought new drives after 3 years of use)
but of course doesn't come close to paying for it. 

Please feel free to contact Randy or me if you have questions
or suggestions.  If there are any glaring holes in the
admittedly meager documentation, let me know.  It will be
improved on a time- and energy- available basis.  Any and all
suggestions, are greatly appreciated.  Hmmm, let me qualify
that - I enjoy hacking up CBBS to add new things.  I solicit
"ideas", but am not really interested in "code".  "Not Invented
Here"?  Mebbe, or perhaps its that I'm a "loaner", and
accepting some mods, means I'd have to accept "them all", and
programming "by committee" just doesn't work outÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ, etc.  

YOU should feel free to "hack up" CBBS to be whatever you want
it to be - perhaps make you changes "modular" to facilitate
integrating them into a possible future release of CBBS.
