This is a file of all CBBS historical comments from v 3.3 on as
of 07/15/81.  I did a full file compare of all cbbs .ASM files.
Changes not otherwise indicated are called "Misc:", i.e. no
date associated with them. 

In July 1981, many of the prompting messages were slightly
shortened; More easy "escape" from some questions was allowed,
etc.

Got rid of "V" command.  ^H always backspaces, del and "_"
echo.

================> CBBS.ASM - MAINLINE

Misc:	Added LEV equate for VER/MOD/LEV;
	

	02/02/80 01
Make "Y/N did I get your name right?" call GETVARN, not GETVAR.
Minor mods to last name question;  Split out print of
statistics (caller, hi msg, # msgs) so it can be called as the
"#" (stats) function. 
	02/03/80 02
Put in "fast" equate
	02/05/80 03
Delete FILEMSK, put in FILEDIV (divisor for last 2 digits of
msg # to decide how many msg files)
	04/21/80 04
Mod doc of contents of file "NEXT" add "ECOUNT" and "CCOUNT"
equates
	06/23/80 05
Put in "TEST" switch to generate code which doesn't look for a
modem.  Also all disk files are assumed to be on the logged on
disk.

---------------- V 3.4

	11/08/80
BUMP ECOUNT, CCOUNT TO 7, 35
	11/10/80 06
Add HELP routines; ADD "-" backing up last name to first;  also
close "NEXT" file after updating. (Technically not needed, but
some BIOS's use the close to flush their buffers).
---------------- V 3.5
	11/15/80 07
Save hi msg # at opening so "-" retrieve will start from there
and go back;
	05/17/81 08
Put in Scitronics clock, and equates to select whether
Scitronics or Computime clock is available.
	07/05/81 09
Change logging so CRLF is written B-E-F-O-R-E someone logs in,
so e.t. is on same line.
	07/06/81 10
Put in mods for "SPECIAL" CBBS/Chicago needs, such as de-
selecting any drive (so steppers stay cool) upon hangup.
	07/28/81
To the "NEXT" file notification process, in addition to "/"
which hangs up on a user, and "*" which flags them as a twit, I
added "+" which causes the scan to continue.  Thus, to leave a
personal message for "Lloyd Smith", but STILL have him see the
">> FLASH <<" that "everyone" sees, the following NEXT file
layout may be used:
	08712
	  258
	   45
	   90
	[LLOYD,SMITH,CALL ME TONIGHT IF YOU CAN  <<WARD>>
	]+[*,*,
	  >> FLASH <<
	7/28 more functions, type:  news
	]

Thus "LLOYD,SMITH," matches him, types the message, but the "+"
after the "]" end-of-message-terminator, says to continue.
	09/13/81
Don't turn off CTLKSW before typing "you are caller..." etc.
Lewis Moseley, CBBS/Atlanta, pointed out this allows "twit" to
^K right to main menu, and avoid "notify" function. ALSO write
date/time to logging tty if both CLOCK and TTY
	10/11/81
Log date/time to logging tty if TTY and CLOCK are true.
	10/17/81
Used to store "city" in "MSGTO".  Change to storing it in
"SUBJ" for compatibility with "CONT" operator command which
wants the "who to" field preserved.

================> CBBSFUNC.ASM - MAINLINE PART 2

	02/02/80 01
PUT IN "#" COMMAND
	04/21/80 02
ADD "DEFUNCT" ROUTINE TO KILL STACKED LINES

---------------- V 3.4

	11/08/80 03
Have "HELP" branch to help, not just "H"
	11/15/80 04
Add HELP msg #'s to GETVAR;  Re-order "?" prompt for functions
to group "major" and "minor" functions.
---------------- V 3.5
	05/18/81 05
Write "]PASSWORD name" on password violation.
Split expert user toggle to be a subroutine
	07/06/81 06
Add "NONE" command to suppress dup chars typed (' ' <= char <
'0'); also add "NEWS" command; Zap off the "INHELP" switch used
to filter "X" thru; Don't CR/LF to file after password
violations logged; Add "NEWS" function to type NEWS file
	07/11/81
Put in typing of only "headlines" in NEWS;  Delete the actual
printing of functions from this file, put them in a file
"function" which allows operators to "customize" this area more
easily.ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ short commands;  Change logic of testing for
4-letter commands from LXI H,ANSWER to PUSH/POP saving HL;
	07/15/81
Put in table lookup, as there are starting to be quite
a few 4 byte commands.
	07/19/81
Get rid of "V" command.  ^H backs up, "_" or 7FH echoes.
Say its not necessary, if "V" is used.
	09/13/81
Hmmm..  Put "V" back in (!), but since the defaults work for
"most people", a new "V", suggested by Jim Willing,
CBBS/Beaverton OR, is to ask for what char is wanted to back up
with.  Any character except a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ";", CR, or TAB, are
allowed

================> CBBSBYE.ASM - GOOD BYE FUNCTION

	02/02/80 01
Don't print "OK - OK - OK -" if stacked comments LINES
	04/21/80 02
Limit # of comments lines

---------------- V 3.4
	11/08/80 03
* Write help keywords which aren't found, to the LOG.
* Make help keyword buffer larger (20, was 10)
* Prompt comments with line #.
---------------- V 3.5
	11/10/80 04
Add help routine msg #'s to getvar routines; prompt comments
with a line #
	07/06/81  05
Don't write crlf after elapsed time
	07/11/81
When double c/r entered in comments, ask: "y/n done".  Idea
from Dav Holle, Chicago. Also, change so help keywords written
with leading, not trailing, cr/lf to be consistent with other
usage.
	07/12/81
Add "Y/N Done?" prompt after pressing return.
	07/15/81
Moved INTQF here from CBBSDISK to keep file sizes more even for
editing, and also because the other help function was here.


================> CBBSSUMM.ASM - SUMMARY FUNCTION

	05/10/80 01
Enhance binary summary search and split out as subroutine; 
split out "SUMCOMP" to scan from current file position,
matching "MSGNO".
	05/18/80 02
Ignore "flagged" summaries ("X" in first byte of # of lines)

---------------- V 3.4

	11/15/80 03
Add help msg #'s to GETVAR
---------------- V3.5
	05/18/81 04
Add "=" as search command, i.e. S;1,=WARD
	07/06/81 04 continued
Significant rewrite of scan logic.  Supports boolean "AND", or,
and and "OR" searches.  EITHER (KEYWORD) OR
(FIELDCHAR)=(KEYWORD) ARE SUPPORTED.   EXAMPLES:
S;1,CP/M		CP/M IN ANY FIELD
S;1,F=WARD&S=CBBS	FROM WARD, AND ABOUT CBBS
S;1,F=WARD|F=RANDY	FROM WARD OR RANDY
S;1,WARD,RANDY,CP/M	WARD OR RANDY OR CP/M IN ANY FIELD

'|' OR ',' MEAN "OR", '&' MEANS AND.  IF A LONE FIELD
OR ONE FOLLOWED BY AN "OR" MATCHES, THE TEST PASSES,
I.E. "CBBS|CP/M&TRS		WILL PASS A-N-Y CBBS,
	BUT ONLY CP/M AND TRS
