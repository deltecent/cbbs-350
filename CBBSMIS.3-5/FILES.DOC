		FILES ON THE CBBS NON-ASM DISK

Updates:
01/03/82	Add LOAD.SUB
12/03/81	Add NEWS, FUNCTION, CRCK stuff.
		Make BIOS just console routines (disk full!)
11/25/81	Put NEWBIOS.ASM here - won't fit on .ASM disk
11/21/81	to delete "FAST" as it doesn't work with CP/M
		2.2, and because not enough room on disk.
12/17/80	to add BUILDSUM, the new version.
06/22/80	Originally written


	Files followed by "<===<<<" should be edited
	before your CBBS goes on the air.

		-CBBSMIS.3-5
I use this in my catalog program as the name of this disk.

		BIOSCON.ASM <===<<<
This is an example of modem and local console I/O that you
could patch into your BIOS for CBBS.  Of interest are the
techniques used in console status, console in, and console out,
which relate to having a remote console (the CBBS caller): the
testing of a sense switch for local or remote operation, and
the returning from BOTH console status and console in, of an
"0FFH" upon carrier loss (required by CBBS.ASM). 

		BUILDSUM.ASM

This program builds or re-builds the summary file from the
message files.  Suppose your message files are on A:, and
BUILDSUM.COM is on B:.  Just type:
	B:BUILDSUM
Optionally, the message disk and summary disk may be specified
by substituting them for M: and B: in this:
	BUILDSUM M: B:

		BULLETIN. <===<<<
The file of bulletins which are printed after the WELCOME at
CBBS sign-on time.  Also printed by B command.

Be sure to edit it and change it to be appropriate to your
system.

		CBBS3.DOC
Miscellaneous documentation on what's new in cbbs for version
3.2

		CBBS33.DOC
Changes from 3.2 to 3.3

		CBBS34.DOC
Changes from 3.3 to 3.4

		CBBSLINK.DOC
How to assemble the CBBS programs using LINKASM.

		CBBSOPER.DOC
Documentation on the operator functions available in CBBS, and
general hints on system maintenance.

		CBBSTEST.COM
A sample 3.4 CBBS system, which you may test just by typing:
CBBS.  It is set to run with all files on the logged in disk,
so be sure to be on that disk before typing CBBS.  I set the
"TEST" equate to false, which ignores sense switches, and
doesn't call the "connect" subroutine.  However, the timeout
for no input activity is still there, and jumps to E000 (the
address of our PROM monitor), so don't let it go too long. 
Pressing any key every few minutes will defeat the timeout. 
(I'll try to remember to NOP the timeout when TEST is TRUE, in
the future).

You can diddle with this program, scan summaries, go into
password mode (password = CBBSPASS) (SEE CBBSOPER.DOC).

		CONVERT.ASC

This program is used to convert message files from the old
format to the new.  Sorry, there is no .ASM program to do the
conversion, but then it is a 1-time thing anyway.  ONLY
suitable if you are going to 50 message files under the new
system.  Would have to be rewritten to go to some other number. 
((Is there a request for a conversion program for other
numbers?)) ((or mebbe you could just sit down for about a day
with a good editor such as wordmaster, and hand-construct the
message files <<ug!>>))

		CRCK.COM, CRCKLIST
Keith Petersen's public domain program for computing the CRC
(cyclical redundancy check) of a file.  CRCK is self
documenting, just type CRCK.  CRCKLIST is a file of the CRCs of
all files on the disk, that you might verify any possible
copying glitches.

		D.COM
Just type D to see the difference in what's on this disk from
what we sent you.  D.COM contains a list of files, as
distributed.  I "set" the names into D.COM via the command: D
SET
You may selectively add, or delete names which D.COM keeps in
itself, by typing:
	D ADD fn.ft	adds fn.ft, so it won't show up.
or	D DEL fn.ft	shows fn.ft is truly gone from the disk

It may also be used as a regular directory listing
program, by typing: D *.*

If you wish to use D.COM on other disks, just pip
it over, then to D SET to initialize it.

		ENTINTRO.
When entering a message, you are asked "Y/N want
help..." - this is the file which has the help.

		ENTRHELP.
If the H subcommand of message entry is used, this
is the more detailed help file which is used.

		FILES.DOC
The file which contains this documentation you are
now reading.

		FIRSTIME. <===<<<
When asked "Y/N is this your first time on the system" this is
the file which is interpreted with a few hints.  Edit it for
your environment.  Sorry, but the hardware definition in this
file is somewhat duplicated by the HARDWARE keyword in file
"HELP".  Remember to change them both, or even delete hardware
from "Firstime".

		FUNCTION
This file contains the menu printed by the "?" command; it was
formerly hard-coded into CBBS.

		HELP. <===<<<
The file which contains the keywords and help info, accessed by
the H function.  It is mostly universal, but edit it and change
any references which were to the original CBBS.  I believe
there are a couple near the end, i.e. keyword WHY.

After changing HELP, be sure to run XHELP to rebuild HELP.IDX.

		HELP.IDX <===<<<
This file, built by XHELP.COM, is an index into the HELP
keyword file.  It allows the CBBS "H" (keyword help) command to
run faster.  If HELP.IDX is not on the disk, CBBS does a
sequential scan of HELP for the keywords.

		HELP2. <===<<<
Gives help on the system, as asked for in the HELP command. 
Each question starts with an "[" and ends with a "]".

		KILLED.
The file of killed messages.  The name of the person who killed
it is logged, followed by the message, which has it's ctl-G
(Bell) stripped off.  If you want to put a message  back into
the proper message file (it was erroneously or mischeviously
killed) do so, by adding the bell char.  Then either BUILD to
get it in the summary file, or manually edit it into the
summary.

I suggest renaming this file whenever it gets near to being 1
extent long, as time to find the end of file when writing more
to it increases if the file is > 1 extent.
	ex: REN K112779=KILLED
Operationally, you will want to PIP the LOG and KILLED files
(and their re-named versions) to another disk periodically.

		LOAD.SUB
A submit file, for use with CP/M 2.2 (requires XSUB).  It turns
a "live" version of CBBS into a "test" version, by making all files
be on the logged in disk, etc.  "submit load a b" where "a" is the
disk that the file to modify is on (e.g. B:) and "b" is either "HEX"
or "COM" depending upon what you want to load.  The .SYM file must
be on the same disk.  You have to save the resultant changed file
yourself.

		LOG.
Logs who called in.  Has the caller number, date
and time (if you have a clock).  Also contains:
]K,nnnnn	for any unsuccessful message kill attempts, and
PASSWORD	for any unsuccessful attempts to enter 
		the system password.

		MESSAGE.X00 <===<<< change msg 1
		MESSAGE.X02 <===<<< change msg 2
		MESSAGE.X10 <===<<< change msg 10,11
		MESSAGE.X12 <===<<< change msg 12,13
		MESSAGE.X14 <===<<< change msg 14,15

		Other MESSAGE.Xnn files may exist.

These were pulled from CBBS/Chicago in late November, 1981.  Of
significance are the messages from 1-20, which are permanent
messages.  You might wish to edit them as a nucleus of system
messages for your CBBS.  Be sure to update headers, and BUILD a
new summary file.  If you don't mind, leave messages 9-11 on as
an "ad" for future CBBS operators (feel free to delete or
change any of these things - CBBS is yours to tailor to your
needs and wishes).


		NEWS <===<<<
This file is typed by the "news" command.  It contains, for
example, information on "what's new".  I invented "news" as a
means to keep people up-to-date on new features of CBBS 3.5. 
You may wish to completely change it, or at least edit it.

Note the format, with "headlines" being one line long, in
capital letters, on a line preceded by the letter "[", which is
the "skip-to" character used by the NEWS command, headline
feature, and by ^C which skips to the next headline.

		NEXT.
Contains the next message number, caller number,
and number of active messages, and names of people who
you want to send short messages to.  The supplied NEXT file:

04031		<- 5 byte next msg # (5 digits, then cr/lf)
    6		<- caller number (lets you start out with 1)
   81		<- number of active messages
  100		<- maximum number of active messages allowed.
[ALFRED,NEUMAN,
]/[AARDV*,COMP*,HOPE YOU'LL SAY CBBS SAN DIEGO IS UP!!
][DAVE,CAULKINS,HOW'S PCNET GOING?
]

N-O-T-E the first 4 lines must appear exactly as they do.  They
may be thought of as 4, 5 byte lines, or as a "linear"
arrangement containing:
<5 byte next message with leading ZEROS><cr/lf>
<5 byte next caller # (leading spaces)><cr/lf>
<5 byte number of active msgs (leading spaces)><cr,lf>
<5 byte Max. number of active msgs (leading spaces)><cr,lf>

A name which you want to look up at logon time, is show,
following a "[".  The first name and last name are followed by
a comma.  An asterisk is allowed to match any characters.  Thus
"[WILL*,SMI*,  will match WILL SMITH, WILLIAM SMIDLEY, etc. 

Following the comma after the last name, put any message you
want to type.  It may be as short as "nothing", i.e. 
	firstname<comma>lastname<comma><cr/lf>,
or multiple  lines, but that slows down the scan time (this
entire file is  scanned any time someone logs on).  End the
message with "]".  I usually put this in the next line, i.e.

[WILL*,SMI*,Hi, will
]

and then typically follow it with the next opening "[". There
are 2 special characters which may follow the "]" after the
message:  a "/" or a "*".  "/" means to immediately hang up on
this caller.  "*" means to flag this caller as a "twit", i.e.
don't allow message entry, kill, or comments.

		OVERVIEW.DOC
An overview of the entire system.

		PASSWORD. <===<<<
This file contains the password which must be entered to go
into operator mode.  Set to "CBBSPASS" as distributed. Note it
must be in upper case.

		SCANHELP.
When S or Q commands are used, CBBS replies "Starting message
#: or ? for help scanning" or something like that. SCANHELP is
the question file which is interpreted if "?" is typed.

		SUMMARY.
This is the message summary file.  It contains the header
(first 2 lines) of each message.  It, like the message files,
is a simple, editable file.  The format of a header is:
	(bell)nnnnn,nn,mm/dd/yy,from,to
	subject,password

For example (I'm using ^G to represent the bell (ctl-g):

^G01234,16,11/23/79,WARD & RANDY,ALL
TEST MESSAGE,NONE

nnnnn (01234) is the message number (must be 5 digits); nn (16)
is the # of lines in the message; mm/dd/yy is the date. (Note
that if you don't have a clock, it might be M/D/YY, etc); from,
to, subject are self-explanatory.  There are limits to their
length, because of the way they are read into memory for
summary scan.  When input, their length is tested.  If entering
a new message with an editor, better check the CBBSWORK.ASM
file to see how much room exists; password is the kill-password.  If no password was given, then just cr/lf follows
the last comma.  If the message is operator-killable only, the
word "NONE" appears.  If user killable, then there is a a 4
letter password.  I know of no user who might have used NONE as
a user password, and therefore resulted in the message being
operator-killable only.

If you have trouble with people killing other peoples messages,
you can edit the summary file, and stick in passwords of NONE
where ever no password was found.  In the editor, type:

ms,^l^z,NONE^l^z

meaning:

m	macro (i.e. over-and-over)
s	substitute
,	a comma followed by
^l	a new line (^l in ED, ^n in wordmaster)
^z	end of string
,NONE^l	change to comma NONE newline (NONE must be upper case)
^z	end of string

		THOUGHTS.DOC
Miscellaneous thoughts about CBBS.

		WELCOME. <===<<<
This is the first file typed when a new caller signs on.  It
tells of control character usage, etc.  Edit it to put your own
CBBS's name in it.  Please preserve the (R) next to CBBS(R) and
"Computerized Bulletin Board Systemm (R)" as CBBS is a
registered trademark.

		XHELP.COM
This program builds the file HELP.IDX, the index into the help
file.  Just log onto the disk which contains the HELP file, and
type XHELP.
