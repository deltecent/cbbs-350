		 CBBSOPER.DOC	as of 11/28/81


     There are additional commands made available to CBBS ç
operators, which are not available to normal CBBS users.  They ç
are allowed only if a correct password has been entered.
     To enter the password, type the command PASS. You will beç
prompted just with a cr/lf.  Enter the password, which will notç
be echoed.  If it is correct, you will be prompted just withç
the function menu, or, if there is an operator file "NOTES", itç
will automatically be typed.  If an incorrect password isç
entered, then the "I don't know what you mean by "pass", so≠
and-so" will be typed, and the line:
	 "]PASSWORD name"
 will be put in the LOG file, as a "log" of an "attemptedç
security violation".
     If you are in operator mode and want to disallow operatorç
commands, (such as when turning the system back to anotherç
user) just type in PASS, and press return as the password, Thisç
will be invalid, and will turn off the "operator mode"  bit,ç
(and log a PASSWORD violation).
     When in operator mode, the retrieve function allows usingç
a "+" sign to indicate "next 10 messages".  I.E. you canç
r;100;+;+ ...the reason for this is that the operators probç
ably want to "scan" all entered messages for appropriateness. ç
This function was originally allowed for everyone, but intendç
ed for operator use only.  Later it became common knowledge,ç
and was made restricted to operators only.  In CBBS/Chicago, weç
recently re-allowed everyone to access it.  We had thought itç
would tie up the system excessively, but "maybe I'm mellowingç
in my old age".  If Y-O-U want to make "+" "public", changeç
the test for operator mode in the CBBSRTRV.ASM module, justç
before label "RTVST".  It tests for a "+", and if so, testsç
for operator mode, and if so, stores 10 into "RTOGO" (how manyç
to go in this retrieve).  Just throw away the 3 instructionsç
(LDA, ORA, JNZ) which relate to the operator mode test.

		CBBS OPERATOR COMMAND HANDBOOK
		       Revised 07/12/81

		       Command Details


     Here are the commands which are made available in operat ç
or mode.  "[" and "]" are used to delimit optional data, i.e.ç
[disk:]fn.ft means MESSAGE.X24 OR B:LOG for example.


CONT
====

     When you have entered a message, and 16 lines aren'tç
enough, simply save the message, then use the CONT command toç
put in the next message.  It enters the same date, who to, andç
for the subject, inserts "(CONT'D)".
     CAUTION: No test is made to see if a valid "WHO TO" had ç
previously been entered.

DIR [[disk:]fn[.ft]]
===
Ex: DIR B:*.*

Ex: DIR B:LOG

     This produces an across-the-screen directory listing.  Theç
extent, and decimal number of 128-byte sectors is shown.   Theç
count of files matching the criteria is shown.
     NOTE if you just want to type DIR, you'll have to type
'DIR ' since the command lookup is for 4 characters.  Normally ç
you would supply a disk, anyway, i.e. 'DIR B:'.
     As of 7/81, DIR B: defaults to DIR B:*.*.


DIRN [[dsk:]filename[.type]]]
====
Ex: DIRN B:

     This is just like DIR except that no details are shown,ç
only a count of the number of files.  Used to see how full theç
directory is.


DUMP startaddr
====
Ex: DUMP FE0

     This does an interpreted (i.e. hex + Ascii) dump, whichç
"runs forever".  Press K to kill it.
     In CBBS/Chicago, we have our logging TTY equate TRUE in ç
the software, but have not printer hooked up. Thus there is theç
256 byte wrap-around buffer sitting in memory, showing the lastç
256 bytes keyed by users. So, when I log on, and go intoç
operator mode (i.e. I have keyed perhaps 40 characters) I dumpç
the log buffer, to see what the last caller was typing.  It isç
sometimes useful to detect someone having trouble, and leavingç
a msg which might help.

ENTR addr.data
====
Ex: ENTR 1234.F1

     Yes, this is one-lousy-byte-at-a-time, but something isç
better than nothing.  I used the "filename formatting" to makeç
it simple to find the byte.  Yes, this could be improved, butç
typically it is for patching one of CBBS switches whileç
testing, or some such.  No, you couldn't patch an instruction ç
which is being executed as you might get 1 byte of addressç
patched, hit the instruction, go off to never-never-land,ç
before getting the second byte patched.



ERA [disk:]fn[.ft]
===
Ex: ERA B:BULLETIN.BAK

     We mostly use this command to ERA B:NOTES, i.e. the fileç
containing notes from one operator to another (or toç
themselves).  Otherwise, it is mostly used when a disk is foundç
to be unusually full, because you forgot to ERA a .BAK fileç
after an edit.  Wild cards are allowed ("?" and "*"), but notç
in the first position of the filename.  Thus ERA *.* is notç
permitted, but ERA M*.* is.


HOLD
====
     When testing or working with CBBS, the "auto hang up onç
someone who walked away" may be annoying.  Typing HOLD willç
disable this function.  Typing it again will re-enable theç
timeout.


NAME
====
     This is simply a command which JMPs to the beginning ofç
the dialog "What is your first name", so it allows an operatorç
to re-log on as someone else.  Typical use is to re-enter aç
message so it will be "from" someone else, (i.e. using theç
(G)et msg subcommand of message entry, editing it, saving it asç
a new msg).
     Another use is when you have company, and are showing ç
CBBS off, and logged on as yourself, then want a guest to go inç
under their own name.  Note: ",R" is logged after the name, toç
show this is a re-log on.
     You can combine the names on a line:

	name;ward;christensen

     Caution - I sometimes forget the ";" between first andç
last name.

NOTE
====
     This function allows an operator to key into a file calledç
NOTES, which is then automatically typed when someone entersç
operator mode.  Use ERA NOTES (or ERA B:NOTES) to delete it. ç
Use TYPE NOTES (or TYPE B:NOTES) to see it again.   If you haveç
seen the notes, typing control-K (or just ASCII K) will abortç
it and go on.

NOTEN
=====
     Just like NOTE, but doesn't append a date/time line.  Useç
it to add notes when you don't want to waste the space.

PRINT
=====
     For local testing, typing PRINT causes all CBBS output toç
be directed to your CP/M BIOS list device.  A second PRINTç
command will turn this off.  Think of it as if it were ^P inç
CP/M command mode.


PURGE
=====
     This command makes a single pass thru the summary fileç
physically deleting all Kill-flagged messages. A Kill-flaggedç
message has an "X" stored as the first byte of the # of lines.
     PURGE works by creating a file WORKFILE, then passing the ç
summary file thru memory one at a time, deleting the "X"edç
ones, and writing good ones to WORKFILE.  When done, SUMMARY isç
erased, and WORKFILE is renamed to SUMMARY.
     N-O-T-E that you must have enough space on the disk for ç
the workfile.  If you have a standard CP/M for which our STATç
command works, (or have modified it), use STAT to determine theç
space left, and DIR SU* to see the size of the summary file.ç
Take the number of records in the summary file, times 128, andç
that is the size.


PURGEN
======
     Like PURGE, but doesn't show what was purged.  Faster whenç
running remotely.


SLOW
====
     Doing CBBS development, then testing it locally, does notç
adequately simulate how it would "look" to a remote user,ç
because things "scroll by" so fast.  SLOW puts a time delay inç
the console output routine.  Typing it a 2nd or 3rd time, slowsç
it down even more.  Typing SLOW a 4th time, restores the systemç
to no-slowdown.

STAT
====
Ex: STAT

     In 7/81 this was completely rewritten to dynamicallyç
determine which disks are logged in, and determine the spaceç
left on each logged in disk.  (Finally!)


TYPE [disk:]filename[.type][,search string]
====
Ex: type b:log

Ex: type b:log,12345

     Type any ASCII file.  ^X skips 10 lines, ^C skips to theç
next "delimiter", i.e. a bell, or a "]".  ^K aborts the type. ç
^S suspends it.
     The search string allows typing the log (or other files) ç
starting at a particular character string.  I use this to typeç
the log starting at the user number one higher than the numberç
I got the last time I called into CBBS.
     Note that this string search does a RDBYTE from the disk,ç
and compare, so does not "back up" properly when it finds dataç
which partially duplicates the start of the string. Thus "TYPEç
B:LOG,0999" wouldn't always match "00999" in the LOG becauseç
the 0 would be compared to the zero, and match, then the 9ç
would mismatch the next 0 read from the file. The next compareç
would be the leading zero of the search string, to the nextç
character read from the file (9), so it wouldn't match.  (Sorç
ry, but something is better than nothing, and this explainsç
away the seldom-occurring "why didn't it find it" problem.)



TYPEH     (see TYPE for operands)
=====
     This is an outgrowth of the NEWS function for printingç
only headlines.  TYPEH types a file, but only lines with a "]"ç
in them, and then only from the character after the "]" on.


TYPEK     (see TYPE for operands)
=====
     TYPEK was invented to check the KILLED file to see thatç
the person killing a message was the "right" person.  If you,ç
for example: "TYPEK B:KILLED", you will see 2 lines printed forç
each message, the first being the "killer", and the second,ç
the FROM/TO line of the message header.  A blank line is thenç
printed.


XCPM
====
     This is simply a JMP 0.  It assumes that you have modemç
I/O in your BIOS, and that you will be able to continue operç
ation remotely, in CP/M itself.
     Note that if you are autoloading CBBS on a cold boot ç
(i.e. running 1.4 and have patched "CBBS" into the commandç
buffer at CCP + 8 (displacement 8 at track 0 sector 2) and 04Hç
at CCP+7 (the command length) then you must ensure that yourç
WARM start routine JMPS to CCP+3, which is the entry point toç
CCP to NOT autoload CBBS (or whatever is in the commandç
buffer)
     If you do not wish to re-enter CBBS to hang up, you willç
have to put together a little .COM file which just outputs theç
appropriate bits for your system. For CBBS/Chicago, it outputsç
to the port to turn off the diskette spin motors, and outputsç
to the PMMI to go back on hook.  We call it PMMIBYE.COM.

		       ----------------

     Any other command you feel would be of value?  Someday Iç
may tackle REName, because we REN Lyymmdd=LOG whenever the logç
gets near 128 sectors (1 extent).  Let me know if you have anyç
ideas.
