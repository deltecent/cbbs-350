Latest thoughts off the top of my head on CBBS, as of 3/3/80.

					Ward Christensen

I was looking for a technique to disseminate some of the newç
mods to CBBS.  The BULLETIN seems the most logical place - butç
I wanted to keep that brief.  Putting them in messages is OK,ç
but people have to be relatively familiar with CBBS to findç
these things.  Thus was born the NEWS file, which is like anç
extended bulletin.  You can type either the "headlines",ç
(1-line details) or the detailed items.  New for Vers 3.5.

It is my intent that the first 20 messages on "every" CBBS beç
essentially the same.  We'd appreciate you keeping messagesç
9-11 so more people might order CBBS based on seeing the "ad"ç
for the software on YOUR system.  Also, message 1 should beç
personalized to give the history of YOUR system.  We'dç
appreciate you giving us credit for the base software, but makeç
everything else appropriate for your involvement.

Call our system to get the latest entries for messages 12, 13,ç
14, which tell of other message systems.  12 is full timeç
CBBSs, 13 is full time other systems, and 14 is any non-fullç
time systems.  It is my practice to try to keep these messagesç
up to date, and if someone has not reported the activity of aç
particular system for 6 months, then delete it. It just costsç
too much to keep calling systems to see if they are still up.

The file FIRSTIME contains a hardware description.  So does theç
help file.  It is up to you to put similar info in both. Maybe,ç
you want to delete the hardware question from the FIRSTIMEç
file, or just say, in FIRSTIME, to type:
	H;HARDWARE
to get details on the hardware.

The CBBS.COM on this disk is a 3.5 version with no modemç
dependencies.  It allows you to "dink" with the system enteringç
messages, etc.  You may run out of disk files if you use it tooç
much, as there are so many other files on the disk, and couldç
be up to 50 message files if you add enough messages.

If you are converting an "old" CBBS to the new message fileç
format, our "convert" program is totally useless unless you areç
going to go to 50 message files.  If you want fewer, thenç
you'll just have to pattern a new BASIC program after the one,ç
but don't dink around as I did trying to "and" bits.  The CBBSç
code uses the following algorithm to map from the decimal valueç
of the last two digits of a message number, to a file number:

	file#=divisor*int(msg#/divisor)

Thus if you use 4 for a divisor, the program will use 25ç
message files.  Message numbers ending in 00, 01, 02, and 03ç
will be written to file MESSAGE.X00, etc.

It is my personal opinion that a CBBS which is up 24 hours aç
day 7 days a week, is many times better than one which is not.ç
This is because if its up always, people don't have to thinkç
about when they may call it.  They can just pick up the phoneç
at any time, and call in.

I'd like to keep some semblance of consistency to CBBS ç
commands.  I would LOVE it if people would somewhat "clear"ç
usage of new 1 letter commands with me.  For example, "L" isç
now accepted as a "list" command by some CBBSers, specificallyç
Steve Vinokuroff of CBBS/Vancouver.  He allows the user to typeç
any .ASM file (he forces the type to .ASM).  L asks for aç
filename, then executes the operator TYPE command after forcingç
type .ASM - Others think about putting the "L" command forç
"linefeeds" because the half-ascii TRS-80 doesn't seem to wantç
them (double spaces) but lets face it, they really should goç
with a full "standard" terminal program.  Back to Steveç
Vinokuroff: He is also thinking of using "F" for "Fileç
transfer".  Hmm, I'd prefer to keep that open for a newç
"forward" command, i.e. "F;1234;CHI" means to "forward messageç
1234 to Chicago".  This is just blue sky at this time, but lotsç
of BBS operators (CBBS/ABBS/FORUM-80/PBBS) are interested inç
message forwarding.

Thoughts for the future:

I'd like to put all commands related to a particular user, (Iç
guess I mean their terminal) and put them into a singleç
command, as Bob Iannucci does with his homebrew BBS system.

Thus "U" for user, is a single command, under which you access:

	A=Alter Baud rate
	C=Change Case
	D=Duplex (echo/no echo)
	N=Nulls
	P=Prompting bells on/off
	V=Video Backspaces
	
Lewis Moseley, CBBS/Atlanta, has done this.

Thus the number of options in the "primary" menu drops by 5ç
(delete 6, add 1 (U)).

I instead just grouped the commands together when you type "?",ç
so you see the 6 major functions, then the other ones.  A bitç
more clear than just presenting all commands in alphabeticalç
order.

			-------------

It is our policy, on a 2 disk, single density system, toç
maintain 280 - 320 active messages.  Seems OK.  Occasionally aç
caller says "get rid of your old messages".  Ya, 320 is a lot. ç
We "suffer" a lot to see someone at 110 baud doing S;1 - egadç
that takes what, almost a half hour?  Some CBBS operators mayç
choose to not even allow 110 baud.

Oh yes, special thanks to the S-100 modem companies (Hayes,ç
IDS, and PMMI) for really making CBBS practical. We probablyç
wouldn't have tried it with an external modem.

P.S. Please excuse redundancy between various .DOC files.
