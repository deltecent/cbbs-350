		  DOCUMENTATION ON THE FILES
		CONTAINED ON THE CBBS .ASM DISK

Last update 11/24/81 - revise for 3.5:
Change CEBIOS.ASM to NEWBIOS.ASM; (then moved it to the otherç
disk - this one's full!); Delete LIST.COM, add T.COM; Addç
CRCK.COM and FILES.CRC;  Change CBBSCLOK.ASM to CBBSCLKC &ç
CBBSCLKS.ASM;  New version of D.COM;  Delete FMAP.COM.  Diskç
too full;  Delete DU.COM;

		COOKBOOK.DOC
Miscellaneous comments to assist in the installation of CBBS.

		CRCK.COM
This program, by Keith Petersen, modified by Ronnie B Stone toç
make its output more abbreviated, computes the CRC (cyclicalç
Reduncancy Check) of any file.  Type: CRCK for usage infor≠
mation.  Specifically, before originally distributing thisç
disk, the following command was typed:
	CRCK *.* F
which created a file "CRCKLIST.CRC".  This was renamed toç
FILES.CRC, so that if YOU run CRCK *.* F you wouldn't "wipeç
out" the one created earlier.  Use this program to check thatç
the files on the disk have not been "corrupted".  The CRC of aç
single file (CRCK CBBSFUNC.ASM for example) should agree withç
the CRC given in the FILES.CRC file.

		D.COM
D shows what's different on the disk from what was sent.  ç
Before shipping, we did "D SET" which set all the names into ç
D.COM. From then on, typing just D tells the difference (what ç
was added, what was deleted).  If you want to use it for other ç
purposes, the options are obtained by typing: D H

NOTE that the SET, ADD, and DEL options all cause D to eraseç
itself from the directory, then write itself back.  Thus theç
disk may not be write protected, and "D" may not be renamed,ç
(such as if you already have a program named D in your ç
directory) because it will erase WHATEVER is called D.COM, and ç
will write itself back as D.COM.  You may patch it under SID or ç
DDT - it's own name is stored at 105H.

		FILES.CRC
A file of the CRC of each file on disk (except for itself,ç
which cannot be done).  See CRCK.COM

		FILES.DOC
This file.

		FIND.COM
Used to find character strings in several files.  Use it to
find in what .ASM file a particular label is, or is used; forç
example, to look for references to the COMPR and KEYCHR
routines: (Note it finding ANY matching string)--+
						 |
A>find b:cbbs*.asm compr|keychr		+--------+
FIND.COM 11/08/80			|
----> FILE CBBSDISK.ASM			V
 271	WRLINE	CALL	SETTABS	;TAB COMPRESS THE LINE
----> FILE CBBSENT2.ASM
----> FILE CBBSSUB1.ASM
  29	CTLCKS	CALL	KEYCHR	;GET CHR
----> FILE CBBSRTRV.ASM
----> FILE CBBSCLKC.ASM
----> FILE CBBSCLKS.ASM
----> FILE CBBSBYE .ASM
 258	BYECR	CALL	KEYCHR	;GET A CHAR
 262	BYECR2	CALL	KEYCHR
----> FILE CBBSKILL.ASM
 154		CALL	COMPR
 168		CALL	COMPR	;MATCH?
	..etc..

Thus FIND did a scan of all CBBS*.ASM files and found the onesç
which matched that character string.  Find can be used forç
almost any  data, of almost any length.  To specify a tab, codeç
"_".  To  specify multiple search arguments, separate them byç
"|".  Thus,  to find all "IN" and "OUT" instructions in allç
.ASM files on  B:, type:

	find b:*.asm _in_|_out_

	Note the use of the "_" tabs to prevent finding all ç
"in" such as "INX" etc.
	Find translates what is read from disk, to upper case,ç
so upper/lower case presents no problem.

		LINKASM.COM
This is the program which links (at source time) all theç
CBBS.ASM files together.  See CBBSLINK.DOC.  You may wish to doç
as I have, rename this to LASM if you get tired of he long name
"LINKASM".

		NEWBIOS.ASM
This is the BIOS for CBBS.  It replaces the older BIOS whichç
was for CP/M 1.3.  This is a 1.4 version.  Sorry, not 2.2 yet. ç
Of interest are the techniques used in console status, consoleç
in, and console out, which relate to having a remote console -ç
the testing of a sense switch for local or remote operation,ç
and the returning from BOTH console status and console in, ofç
an "0FFH" upon carrier loss (required by CBBS.ASM).  The olderç
1.3 version loaded CBBS by "brute force", while this BIOS doesç
it through the auto-command feature of CP/M (whereby if youç
patch a command into the CCP buffer, it will automaticallyç
execute).

Also of interest, since most CBBS systems run 24 hours a day,ç
is the logging of disk errors, into a table at the end of theç
BIOS.  Each time the system is warm booted (the operator XCPMç
command from CBBS), the errors, if any, are printed.  Thisç
helps detect marginal drives or media. 

		RESTORE.ASM	12/17/80
A program to restore killed messages.  Fetches the killed ç
message from "KILLED", merges it back in with MESSAGE.Xnn, adds ç
1 to the count of active messages stored in "NEXT", and then ç
binary searches the summary, and un-"X"es the summary. Note ç
therefore that it only completely works if the PURGE command ç
has not yet been run under CBBS, which would have deleted the ç
"X"ed summary.  However, all other processing will have ç
completed properly.  You mighe hand-edit the summary in, or use ç
BUILDSUM to get it back in.

 		T.COM
In the FIND example above, a line number was given.  T is  likeç
TYPE but allows a starting line number.  Typing:
	T CBBSSUB1.ASM 230
would start listing at line 230.  

Details on usage of "T" is obtained by typing just "T".

You may "browse" the CBBS .ASM files by typing:
	T CBBS*.ASM
at which time ^S will hold the output, ^X will skip to the nextç
file, or ^C will abort completely.  To minimize disk usage, Tç
buffers memory as full as possible.  Thus you see a delay fromç
typing the T command, to it actually starting to type, asç
memory is filled.
